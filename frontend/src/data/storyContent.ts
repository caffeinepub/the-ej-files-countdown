    title: "FILE #1: THE DIDDY CONNECTION",
    sections: [
      {
        heading: "Atlanta, Summer 2023",
        content: "EJ was 17 when his Twitch channel first blew up — a Black kid from the A going viral for his unfiltered gaming commentary and reaction content. By 18, he had 400K subscribers on YouTube and a Twitch following that rivaled creators twice his age. That's when the industry started paying attention. That's when Diddy's people reached out."
      },
      {
        heading: "The DiddyCoin Venture",
        content: "The pitch came through a DM from a verified account: Sean Combs wanted to meet. EJ flew to New York on a private jet — his first time — and sat across from Diddy in a penthouse suite overlooking Manhattan. The idea was 'DiddyCoin,' a blockchain platform designed to pay creators directly, cutting out the platforms taking their cuts. For EJ, a young content creator who'd watched YouTube demonetize his videos for 'community guidelines violations,' the pitch hit different. He was in."
      },
      {
        heading: "The $15 Million Raise",
        content: "EJ became the face of the project — the young, authentic, digitally-native voice that gave DiddyCoin credibility with Gen Z. They raised $15 million. EJ was featured in Forbes 30 Under 30 nominations, Complex, and The Shade Room. He was flying private, doing press runs, and posting content from places he'd only seen in rap videos. His chat was going crazy. His subscribers doubled."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Collapse",
        content: "By the time EJ turned 19, the whole thing had unraveled. The blockchain infrastructure was vaporware. The 'creator fund' never materialized. Investors started asking questions EJ couldn't answer because nobody had given him the real answers. Then the allegations dropped — mismanaged funds, fraudulent projections, and a paper trail that somehow kept circling back to EJ's name. Diddy's team went silent. His lawyers went public. EJ was left holding the bag."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Aftermath",
        content: "The SEC opened an inquiry. EJ's Twitch was brigaded. His YouTube comments became a war zone. The same internet that built him up spent two weeks trying to tear him down. He went live one night, no script, no PR team — just him, his hoodie, and the truth as he knew it. The stream hit 80K concurrent viewers. He maintains to this day that he was the youngest and most expendable person in the room, and that's exactly why they put his name on everything."

        content: "EJ had just turned 19 and was fresh off the DiddyCoin fallout when a brand deal took him to Aspen for a ski resort collab. He didn't ski. He'd never skied. But the check cleared, so he went. That's where he met Madison (@MadisonWinterVibes) — a lifestyle influencer with 800K followers, a ring light tan, and a very specific interest in EJ that only seemed to activate when his camera was on."

        heading: "The Six-Month Spending Spree",
        content: "What followed was a masterclass in what the internet would later call 'parasocial projection.' EJ, a 19-year-old who'd grown up watching his mom stretch a paycheck, suddenly had money and someone who seemed to want him. Over six months, he spent exactly $100,000. His boys tried to tell him. His chat tried to tell him. Even GGFan — one of his most loyal long-time viewers — posted a 47-second clip compilation of red flags in the Twitch chat. He turned off the donations and kept spending. The breakdown:"

      {
        heading: "The Reality Check",
        content: "Their 'relationship' existed almost entirely on FaceTime and Instagram Stories where she'd tag him for the clout bump. She was always too busy to actually link. EJ told himself she was just private, just cautious, just needed time. He made content about 'protecting your peace' while quietly funding someone else's lifestyle. His audience noticed the vibe shift before he did."

        heading: "The Paparazzi Photos",
        content: "July 2024. Paparazzi photos dropped of Madison on a yacht in Monaco with an NBA player she'd apparently been with for over a year — the entire time EJ had been in his feelings. The photos went viral on Twitter/X. Someone clipped EJ's old stream where he'd vaguely referenced 'someone special' and put it side by side with the Monaco photos. The ratio was devastating. His chat was merciless."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Lesson",
        content: "EJ went dark for two weeks. When he came back, he posted a 22-minute YouTube video titled 'I Was Stupid' that hit 4 million views in 48 hours. No edits, no music, no B-roll — just him talking to a camera in his bedroom. He said the $100K wasn't the real loss. The real loss was the six months he spent auditioning for someone who'd already cast someone else. He deleted her contact, blocked every account, and started a series on his channel about self-worth. It became his most-watched content to date."

      {
        heading: "The First Episode — 2022",
        content: "EJ was 16 when it started. He was mid-stream, playing Valorant, when he suddenly described — in real time, to 3,000 live viewers — the exact outcome of a match he hadn't played yet. He laughed it off. His mods clipped it. Nobody thought much about it. But EJ knew something was different. The memories weren't dreams. They were too specific. Too loud."

      },
      {
        content: "1. Super Bowl LVIII (February 2024): In October 2023, EJ recorded a private video — timestamped, uploaded to a private YouTube link shared with his manager — predicting the exact final score of a Super Bowl still four months away. When the game played out exactly as he'd described, his manager called him at 2am and didn't say a word for thirty seconds.\n\n2. The Twitch Subathon Record (March 2024): EJ told his Discord mods in January 2024 that a specific streamer would break the all-time subathon record in March, naming the exact week. He was right down to the day. He screenshotted the original message and posted it after. The internet called it a stunt. He knows it wasn't.\n\n3. His Cousin's Signing (August 2024): In early 2023, EJ described in detail his cousin's record deal signing — the label, the city, the producer in the room — eighteen months before it happened. His cousin wasn't even making music seriously at the time. When it happened exactly as EJ described, his cousin stopped asking questions and started keeping distance."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Pocket Watch",
        content: "The episodes intensified after EJ found a mysterious antique pocket watch at an estate sale in Atlanta in 2022. The watch doesn't work — frozen at 11:47 — but whenever he holds it during a stream, the chat notices something shifts in his energy. Horologists say it's from the 1890s. One noted unusual engravings on the inner casing that don't match any known watchmaker's mark. EJ keeps it in a sock drawer and tries not to touch it."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Documentation",
        content: "EJ now keeps encrypted voice memos on a secondary phone that never connects to the internet. He records every episode — dates, details, outcomes. He's terrified of becoming a target. A 20-year-old creator with a platform and apparent foreknowledge of future events is not someone who can afford to be careless. He's told three people. All three signed NDAs. One of them — believed by insiders to be GGFan, a longtime community member with access to EJ's private Discord — stopped responding to his texts."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Burden",
        content: "Living with knowledge of future events is not the gift it looks like from the outside. EJ has watched friendships end knowing they would. He's seen opportunities he couldn't take without explaining how he knew they'd pay off. The DiddyCoin disaster? He saw the collapse coming six months out but couldn't say anything without revealing himself. Madison? He knew she was using him and stayed anyway, hoping the future wasn't fixed. It was."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Question",
        content: "Is EJ a time traveler? Does he experience genuine precognition? Is the pocket watch a trigger or a coincidence? He doesn't have answers. What he has is a private YouTube playlist of 47 timestamped prediction videos, a sock drawer he avoids, and the particular exhaustion of a 20-year-old who has already lived too much of his future. These files are his record. Whatever happens next, at least someone will know he tried to tell the truth."

      {
        heading: "CLASSIFICATION LEVEL: RESTRICTED",
        content: "What follows is a reconstructed account of events between January 2024 and October 2024, compiled from leaked Discord messages, anonymous industry sources, and one very uncomfortable Twitch VOD that has since been deleted. The subject: EJ. The company: PopCap Games. The allegation: that a 20-year-old Twitch streamer from Atlanta nearly brought down one of gaming's most beloved studios from the inside."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Sponsorship That Started It All",
        content: "It began innocuously enough. PopCap Games — makers of Plants vs. Zombies, Bejeweled, and Zuma — approached EJ for a sponsored stream series in early 2024. His audience skewed young, nostalgic, and deeply online. Perfect demographic for a studio trying to revive its IP catalog. EJ agreed. The check was good. The games were childhood classics. He went live."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Leaked Build",
        content: "During the third sponsored stream, EJ was given early access to an unannounced Plants vs. Zombies title — under strict NDA. What happened next is disputed. EJ claims he accidentally shared his screen during a Discord call that was being recorded by a third party. PopCap's legal team claims the leak was deliberate, orchestrated to generate hype and drive up EJ's streaming numbers ahead of a contract renegotiation. Either way, footage of the unreleased game hit Reddit within hours. It had 2 million views before PopCap's DMCA team could respond."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Fallout",
        content: "PopCap's parent company EA sent a cease-and-desist within 24 hours. EJ's management team went into crisis mode. The gaming press ran with the story. 'Streamer Leaks Unannounced PopCap Title' trended on Twitter/X for two days. EJ's Twitch was temporarily suspended pending review. His YouTube ad revenue was frozen. The gaming community was split — half calling him reckless, half calling him a hero for exposing what they claimed was a cynical cash-grab sequel nobody asked for."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Internal Emails",
        content: "Three months later, an anonymous source leaked internal PopCap emails suggesting the 'accidental' leak had actually been green-lit by a mid-level marketing executive as a guerrilla campaign — using EJ as an unwitting distribution channel. The executive had allegedly calculated that a 'leak' through a popular creator with EJ's reach would generate more authentic buzz than a traditional press release. EJ had been played. Again. The executive was quietly reassigned. EJ received no apology."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Current Status",
        content: "As of today, the NDA litigation is ongoing. EJ cannot discuss the specifics on stream, which has not stopped him from going live and staring directly into the camera in silence for exactly 47 seconds whenever a viewer asks about PopCap. His lawyers say this is not an admission of anything. His chat has made it a meme. The unreleased game has still not been officially announced. The deleted VOD has been re-uploaded to seventeen different accounts. PopCap has not commented."

      {
        heading: "CLASSIFICATION LEVEL: EYES ONLY",
        content: "This file documents one of the most improbable financial arrangements in the history of children's educational television. The subject is EJ — 20 years old, Twitch streamer, YouTuber, and, according to documents obtained by this office, a covert financial backer of the Jim Henson Company's PBS animated series 'Sid the Science Kid.' This is not a joke. We wish it were."
      },
      {
        heading: "Background: Why Sid the Science Kid?",
        content: "For the uninitiated: Sid the Science Kid is a CGI animated PBS series that ran from 2008 to 2013, following a curious young boy who asks questions about the world around him. The show was groundbreaking — one of the first major children's programs to center a child protagonist in a STEM context. It aired when EJ was approximately 2 to 7 years old. According to sources close to EJ, he has described the show as 'the reason I got into tech.' He owns three Sid plushies. This is documented."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Investment",
        content: "In late 2023, the Jim Henson Company began exploring a Sid the Science Kid revival — a new season targeting Gen Alpha with updated STEM curriculum and modern animation. Funding was needed. Through a series of LLCs traced back to a production investment firm in Delaware, a significant contribution — estimated between $200,000 and $400,000 — was made by an anonymous investor. That investor, sources confirm, was EJ. He was 19 years old. He had just finished paying off the Snow Bunny debt."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Motive",
        content: "Why would a 20-year-old Twitch streamer secretly fund a PBS kids' show? EJ has never confirmed the investment publicly. But in a now-deleted tweet from November 2023, he wrote: 'Somebody gotta make sure the little homies see themselves asking questions on TV. That's not a charity. That's infrastructure.' The tweet was up for eleven minutes before being deleted. Screenshots exist. His fans have been trying to decode it ever since."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Cover Story",
        content: "EJ's management has consistently denied any involvement in children's television financing. When a journalist from a gaming outlet asked him directly during a press junket, EJ laughed for an uncomfortably long time, said 'I'm 20, bro,' and changed the subject to his upcoming Minecraft series. His lawyer issued a statement calling the reports 'speculative and without merit.' The statement did not include a denial."
      },
      {
        heading: "The Significance",
        content: "If confirmed, EJ's investment in Sid the Science Kid would represent something genuinely remarkable: a young content creator who grew up watching a kid on TV ask questions about science, quietly using his platform money to make sure the next generation of kids gets the same thing. The classified nature of this file is not to protect EJ from embarrassment. It is because, in a media landscape that profits from cynicism, an act this sincere is genuinely dangerous information."
