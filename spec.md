# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a YouTube channel button exclusively on the File 5 story page that links to the E.J. Money YouTube channel.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a prominently styled button on the fifth story page (File 5) only
- Button opens https://www.youtube.com/@E.J-Money in a new browser tab when clicked
- Button is visually distinct from the existing previous/next navigation buttons and placed near the bottom of the page content

**User-visible outcome:** Readers on File 5 will see a clearly visible YouTube channel button that takes them to the E.J. Money YouTube channel in a new tab.
