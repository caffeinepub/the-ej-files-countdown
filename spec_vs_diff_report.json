StoryPage.tsx conditionally renders a red YouTube button (with SiYoutube icon) only when story.pageNumber === 5, linking to exactly https://www.youtube.com/@E.J-Money with target='_blank' and rel='noopener noreferrer'. The button is visually distinct from the previous/next navigation buttons (different color, size, and style). All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",
